# EloOffice11-Export

A tool that will bring your EloOffice11 Export to a human readable format.


Right now the tool is able to keep the folder structure of the Archive. It will lookup the names you gave your documents and add the deposition date in front of the original file name in the YYMMDD_ format.

Every other Data you inserted into the DMS will be lost.




# How to


To use it you need an Export that you can get here:

When that is finished start this tool, choose the path to the export and just let it run.
